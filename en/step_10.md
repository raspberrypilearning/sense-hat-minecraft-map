## What next?

Now you've created a Minecraft Map on your Sense HAT:

- Make a [Minecraft Photobooth](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/minecraft-photobooth/) with a camera module
- Try making your own 8x8 pixel art, game or animation on the Sense HAT display
- Look at the sensors on the Sense HAT and try to use them along with the LED display! See [Getting started with the Sense HAT](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat)
- Think about what you would do with a Sense HAT in space! See the [Astro Pi](http://astro-pi.org/) competition
