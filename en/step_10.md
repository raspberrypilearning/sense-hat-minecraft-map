## What next?

Now you've created a Minecraft Map on your Sense HAT:

- Make a [Minecraft Photobooth](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/minecraft-photobooth/) with a camera module
- Create a ["Whac-a-Block" game](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/minecraft-whac-a-block-game/) in Minecraft
- Try making your own 8x8 pixel art, game or animation on the Sense HAT display
- Look at the sensors on the Sense HAT and try to use them along with the LED display! See the [Astro Pi Guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-astro-pi/)
- Think about what you would do with a Sense HAT in space! See the [Astro Pi](http://astro-pi.org/) competition
